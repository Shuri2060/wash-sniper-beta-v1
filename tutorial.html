            You may use separate wallets for holding $WASH and sniping.
            <ol>
                <li>Select wallet (EVM address) holding $WASH in your wallet extension (Rabby, Metamask, etc). Sign tx to prove ownership & login.</li>
                <li>Select sniper wallet in your wallet extension. Fund with Hyperliquid L1 <b>spot</b> USDC to snipe. Enable the sniper (similar process to Establishing Connection on HL - this creates an API wallet)</li>
                <li>Queue your sniping orders. Your sniping Marketcap is determined by your price, it will show. Note you are choosing the worst price you can accept, it could fill for better.</li>
                <li>Trigger the sniper. This can be done manually or by setting the timer. <b>The sniping page needs to stay open, and ideally focused. This is a local sniper</b></li>
                <li>To check how the sniper did, check your trade history on the sniping wallet on the Hyperliquid Frontend. (TODO: will add this on page directly later)
                    <ul>
                        <li>Order History: This is your sniping attempts. If you see none there, the sniper failed to work (report this)</li>
                        <li>Trade History: This is your fills</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>
